            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Now very briefly (before wee diſcend to the vſe of this doctrine, <note place="margin">Definition of loue.</note> and come to the application) let vs conſider what this loue is, which will worke ſuch wonders, &amp; bring men to ſuch perfection. Loue in briefe is an affection of the ſoule, by which it doth ſettle it ſelfe in the liking of a good thing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the kind and degree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: or loue is that power of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:173509:66"/> heart, whereby it doth reſt it ſelfe in the approbation and liking of that which is good in its kind, and according to the degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therein. Hence <gap reason="foreign">

When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in our hearts and ſoules wee are quietly and fully poſſeſſed with the liking and embracing of any of our fellow members and brethren in Chriſt according to their worth and dignity as they are Chriſtians, then doe wee loue them indeed ſpiritually, and as Chriſtians ought to loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  </p>
                  <p>But my counſell vnto all is this, Let not the Temple of God bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſad; ô temper your conceiued griefe for that which in him yee haue loſt, with a truly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ioy of the happineſſe which he hath found, and as the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſeth, ſorrow not without hope <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 4. 13.</note> for him that is aſleepe, It is but a ſleep which is miſ-called death, his graue is his bed, and he ſhall awake as ſure as he lay downe, yea more freſh and glorious in the great day of reſurrection. Wherefore if this caſt any of you downe, that hee is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:173509:137"/> now gone from you: let this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine lift you vp, that you muſt (God knows how ſoone) goe to him, <hi>praeit non perit, praemittitur non amittitur</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the <note place="margin">Cypr.</note> like caſe) He is gone before, he is not loſt <hi>Non dolendum igitur quod deceſſit, ſed gaudendum quod praeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.</hi> Let vs not therefore bee ſorry becauſe hee is departed, but rather reioice becauſe he is exalted in the court of heauen, where all that haue liued in Gods feare, and dyed in his fauour, are arriued in ſafety. They are gone before, and follow after we muſt, and I hope we ſhall, and I pray God we may.</p>
                  <p>Now the Lord Ieſus grant vs all grace, ſo to follow him, and his faithfull ſeruants in holines heere, that wee may raigne with him and the Saints departed in happineſſe heerafter, euen in the new Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, where we ſhall bee good and not perſecuted, rich and not rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, Kings &amp; not flattered, where we ſhall bee rauiſhed with ſeeing,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:173509:138"/> ſatisfied with enioying, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for retaining of vnconceiuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble happineſſe, happie eternitie and eternall glory. To the which hee bring vs, that by his pretious bloud hath bought vs; to whom with the Father the inexhauſtible fountaine of goodnes, and the holy Ghoſt the indiuiſible power of them both, wee aſcribe and deſire to bee aſcribed, all praiſe and power, might, maieſtie, and dominion now and foreuermore.</p>
